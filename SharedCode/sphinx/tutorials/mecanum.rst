Mecanum Drive
=============

Mecanum drive allows the robot to move at any angle and rotate in place. This
will make it faster and more effective to maneuver the robot, like lining up to
press a button. Mecanum wheels have lower grip, causing it to be less effective
to go up/down ramps or climb over obstacles.

The roller component of the wheel should create a diagonal between the
front-left and bottom-right, and between the front-right and bottom-left. The
following equations can be used to control the mecanum wheels. See `Simplistic
Control of a Mecanum Drive
<http://thinktank.wpi.edu/resources/346/ControllingMecanumDrive.pdf>`__ for
details.

The following mathematical description uses a robot frame where :math:`x` is
forward and :math:`y` is to the left.

.. math::

    V_{front,left} &= V_d sin \left ( -\theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4} \right ) - V_\theta \\
    V_{front,right} &= V_d cos \left ( -\theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4} \right ) + V_\theta \\
    V_{back,left} &= V_d cos \left ( -\theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4} \right ) - V_\theta \\
    V_{back,right} &= V_d sin \left ( -\theta_d + \frac{\pi}{4} \right ) + V_\theta

================ ===================================================
Variable         Description
================ ===================================================
:math:`V_x`      Motor power for wheel :math:`x` [-2, 2].
:math:`V_d`      The desired robot speed [-1, 1].
:math:`\theta_d` Desired robot angle while moving [0, :math:`2\pi`].
:math:`V_\theta` Desired speed for changing direction [-1, 1].
================ ===================================================

The robot must be controlled by a gamepad with joysticks, so from these
joysticks you need to determine :math:`V_d`, :math:`\theta_d`,
:math:`V_\theta`. The left joystick's direction will be used for
:math:`\theta_d`, and the joystick's magnitude for :math:`V_d`. The right
joystick's x-axis value will be used for :math:`V_\theta`. This will provide
first-person-shooter style control. The following equations will provide this
for joysticks :math:`J_x`.

.. math::

    V_d &= \sqrt{J_{left, x}^2 + J_{left, y}^2} \\
    \theta_d &= arctan(-J_{left, x}, J_{left y}) \\
    V_\theta &= -J_{right, x}

These functions don't account for bounded outputs. That is, the joystick inputs
can yield an output power greater than 100%, which isn't possible. In order to
maintain intent of control, we need to preserve the ratios of the motors. We
can do this by scaling the motors uniformly by the max magnitude, effectively
normalizing to 100%.

.. math::

    V_{max} &= max_j V_{motor, j} \\
    V_{motor, i} &= \frac{V_{motor, i}}{V_{max}}

:doc:`../javasphinx/com/github/pmtischler/control/Mecanum`. One of the custom
additions in `pmtischler/ftc_app <https://github.com/pmtischler/ftc_app>`__ is
a class to perform the Mecanum calculation.  It takes the desired robot speed,
velocity angle, and rotation speed. It returns the speeds of each motor after
clamping. In order to use it, you'll need to import the code.

.. code-block:: java

  import com.github.pmtischler.control.Mecanum;


**Add Mode Select**. We want the ability to control the robot with mecanum
wheels or with regular wheels. Add the following member variable which will
select between the two. This will allow you to select the control style by
changing this variable, without having to change your code.

.. code-block:: java

  private final boolean shouldMecanumDrive = true;

**Add Mecanum Drive**. The mecanum drive is a straightforward implementation of
the formulas above. Update the ``loop`` function with the following code.

.. code-block:: java

  public void loop() {
    if (shouldMecanumDrive) {
        // Convert joysticks to desired motion.
        Mecanum.Motion motion = Mecanum.joystickToMotion(
                            gamepad1.left_stick_x, gamepad1.left_stick_y,
                            gamepad1.right_stick_x, gamepad1.right_stick_y);

        // Convert desired motion to wheel powers, with power clamping.
        Mecanum.Wheels wheels = Mecanum.motionToWheels(motion);
        leftFrontMotor.setPower(wheels.frontLeft);
        rightFrontMotor.setPower(wheels.frontRight);
        leftBackMotor.setPower(wheels.backLeft);
        rightBackMotor.setPower(wheels.backRight);
    } else {
        // ... previous loop code.
    }
  }

Congratulations, you now have the ability to drive with Mecanum wheels!
